# NodeMCU
## Project-GEOLOCATION
### Index
### Introduction of project
In this project we will print the latitude and longitude of the device on an OLED Display with the help of a NodeMCU. For this we will use a NodeMCU, OLED display for the hardware part and ipstack geolocation API, Aurdino IDE for the software part.
### Hardware
### Software
#### Setting Up The API
1. Open [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/).
2. Sign Up on ipstack as shown in figures below.
3. Copy the API access key.
#### Main Code
1. Copy the code from [this file](/geolocation.md).
2. Write your wifi name in place of 'SSID' and your wifi password in place of 'PASS'.
3. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' by the API key copied.
